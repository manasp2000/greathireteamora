# GreatHire Teamora — WorkTrack

A full-stack workforce management platform: attendance tracking, leave management,
employee directory & profiles, reports/analytics, notifications, and team messaging —
with role-based access control (admin vs. employee) across both the API and the UI.

```
greathire-teamora/
├── frontend/   React 18 + Vite + Tailwind CSS (shadcn/ui conventions)
└── backend/    Node.js + Express API (in-memory data by default, MongoDB-ready)
```
Each app has its own detailed README — [`frontend/README.md`](./frontend/README.md) and
[`backend/README.md`](./backend/README.md) — with full folder structures and API
references. This top-level README is the fastest way to get both running together and
see what's in the app.

## Quick start

You need two terminals — one for the API, one for the UI.

**1. Backend** (`http://localhost:5000`)

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev
```

No database setup is required to try the app: the backend seeds a realistic in-memory
dataset (employees, attendance history, leave requests, notifications, and conversations)
on startup. See `backend/.env.example` if you want to point it at MongoDB instead.

**2. Frontend** (`http://localhost:5173`)

cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev


**3. Sign in**

Every seeded employee shares one demo password (see `backend/README.md` /
`SEED_USER_PASSWORD` in `backend/.env.example`):

```
password123
```

("Continue with Google/Microsoft" stays disabled until OAuth env vars are set — everything
else works without them.)

## What's in the app

**Admin views**
- Dashboard — live workforce snapshot, metrics, recent activity
- Employee Directory & Profiles — add/edit employees, stat cards, work summary, activity heatmap, documents
- Attendance Management — live attendance table, check-in/out, CSV export
- Leave Management — request queue with status filtering, approve/reject, approve-all, CSV export
- Reports & Analytics — attendance trends and working-hours charts across 7d/30d/12m
- Notifications Center — filterable feed, read/unread, preferences, CSV export
- Messages — channels + DMs, search within a conversation, emoji, attachments

**Employee self-service**
- Personal dashboard — status, quick actions (check in/out, break), hours stats
- Attendance calendar with month-to-month navigation
- Leave balances with an in-app "Apply for Leave" flow, upcoming holidays, quick links, announcements
- My Profile — personal info editing, documents, account settings

**Cross-cutting**
- Role-based access control end-to-end: the API enforces auth (`requireAuth`) and
  admin-only actions (`requireRole("admin")`) on sensitive routes (exports, approvals,
  employee edits), and the UI mirrors this with route guards
  (`ProtectedRoute`/`PublicOnlyRoute`) and conditional admin-only controls.
- Refresh-token session handling (rotated opaque tokens, see `backend/README.md`).
- One global light/dark theme (persists across reload, respects system preference,
  toggle from either topbar or Account Settings).
- Every button, card, row, and nav item routes somewhere real or is clearly and honestly
  disabled — no dead UI.
- CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) lints/tests the backend and lints/builds the frontend
  on every push and PR.

|---|---|
| **Frontend** | React 18, Vite, React Router (with lazy-loaded/code-split routes), Tailwind CSS + CSS variables, shadcn/ui-style primitives, lucide-react, recharts |
| **Backend** | Node.js, Express, JWT access + refresh tokens (jsonwebtoken + bcryptjs), Zod request validation, Mongoose (optional MongoDB), Passport (optional Google/Microsoft OAuth), Pino logging |
| **Data** | In-memory seeded store by default; swappable for MongoDB via `MONGODB_URI` |

```

Full details, including a complete backend API reference (every route mapped to the
frontend component that calls it, and which routes require which role), live in the two
sub-READMEs linked above.

## Navigation / Sidebar

All authenticated pages render one shared sidebar component,
`frontend/src/components/layout/MasterSidebar.jsx`. It reads `useAuth()`'s
`user.role` and renders the right nav items for that role by calling
`getNavItemsForRole(role)` from `frontend/src/data/navConfig.js` — the single
source of truth for what shows up in the sidebar, for both roles:

```js
export const ADMIN_NAV_ITEMS = [ /* Dashboard, Employees, Attendance, ... */ ];
export const EMPLOYEE_NAV_ITEMS = [ /* Dashboard, Attendance, Leave, ... */ ];
export function getNavItemsForRole(role) {
  return role === "admin" ? ADMIN_NAV_ITEMS : EMPLOYEE_NAV_ITEMS;
}
```

**To add, remove, relabel, or re-icon a nav item:** edit `navConfig.js` only.
No page-level changes are needed — every page picks up the change automatically
because they all render the same `<MasterSidebar />`, not a local copy.

```js
{ label: "Payroll", href: "/payroll", icon: DollarSign }
```

added to `ADMIN_NAV_ITEMS` shows up in the admin sidebar on every admin page,
immediately.

This replaced an earlier state where 7 pages each hand-rolled their own
sidebar markup — inconsistent branding, copy-paste nav bugs (mislabeled
links, wrong hrefs), and missing links were the result. `Sidebar.jsx`,
`EmployeeSidebar.jsx`, and `SidebarNavItem.jsx` (the old per-role sidebar
components) have been removed; `MasterSidebar.jsx` is now the only sidebar
component in the codebase.

## Notes

- The backend's in-memory data resets on server restart — expected behavior for local
  dev/demo, not a bug. Point `MONGODB_URI` at a real database to persist it.
- Most feature routes require a valid access token (`requireAuth`); a handful of
  admin-only actions (CSV exports, approvals, employee record edits) additionally
  require the `admin` role (`requireRole("admin")`) and are hidden from non-admin users
  in the UI as well.
- A few UI actions (voice/video calling in Messages, document downloads on profiles) are
  intentionally disabled with an explanatory tooltip rather than faked, since there's no
  backend support for them yet.
