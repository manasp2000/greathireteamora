# GreatHire WorkTrack

Pixel-match implementation of two "Teamora" screens, built with React + Vite, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui conventions:

- **`/`** — Sign in to Teamora (login screen)
- **`/dashboard`** — Admin Dashboard (workforce overview)

Submitting the sign-in form navigates from `/` to `/dashboard`.

## Stack

- React 18 + Vite
- React Router (`react-router-dom`) for the two pages
- Tailwind CSS (with CSS variables, matching shadcn/ui's theming approach)
- Hand-rolled shadcn/ui primitives (`Button`, `Input`, `Label`, `Checkbox`, `Badge`, `Card`) built with `class-variance-authority` + `tailwind-merge`, following the exact shadcn file/API conventions so they're swappable with `npx shadcn add` output later
- `lucide-react` for icons

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Build for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Navigation

This app has grown past the original two screens above — every authenticated
page now shares one sidebar, `src/components/layout/MasterSidebar.jsx`, which
renders role-appropriate nav items from `src/data/navConfig.js`. See the
"Navigation / Sidebar" section in the [top-level README](../README.md) for
details on how to add or change a nav item. There is no per-page sidebar
component anymore.

## Notes

- Layout is a two-column CSS grid on `lg` breakpoints and up; the marketing hero panel collapses on smaller screens so the sign-in card remains the focus on mobile/tablet, matching how this kind of split-screen auth layout is expected to respond.
- Colors, spacing, radii and type sizes are all driven by Tailwind config tokens (`brand.*` palette, `--radius`, `shadow-panel`) rather than inline styles or one-off magic numbers, so the theme can be retargeted from a single place.
- Google/Microsoft buttons use inline brand-mark SVGs (`BrandIcons.jsx`) rather than external logo assets, so the project has no image dependencies.
